Considering the week after the next presentation, we will restart our weekly group meeting on Tuesday evening at 20:00. 

For these two weeks mission, we are going to achieve 
1. Further polish our requirement analysis document (which has already been drafted before winter vacation) for the first step of "reflective report". 
2. Push the process of web development as we have already equipped with enough techniques. 

Deadlines for every member
Before Monday April 12th 18:00, I(document development) will upload a integrated version of our requirement analysis file together with samples that I found on the Internet. 
Before next Tuesday April 13th weekly meeting, every member should given at least one comment using Github for weekly meeting discussion.
(Ideally each member comes up comments for their own part)

I will upload our first meeting record in 2021.01.27 9:00 soon and record following content of weekly meeting.
